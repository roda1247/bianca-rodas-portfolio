How do you plan to do that? &gt; I want to emphasize the top contributors to plastic pollution by filtering the top 10.\nWhat is missing from your data or would need to change in your data to create these visualizations? &gt;I would need to use pivot to change the plastic types from columns to a new variable.I also need to group the companies and summarise the total counts."
