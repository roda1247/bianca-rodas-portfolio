I also grouped parent companies and summarized the total count to look at the top ten companies linked to the trash collected. I also wanted to pivot some column titles to become values in a new variable called “type”."

On the left we have the branded counts in purple which we can observe a value that exceeds 5,000,000 counts. On the right side, we have unbranded counts in yellow which we can observe over 3,000,000 counts.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure. Total plastic counts between plastics that was found branded (Purple bar) or unbranded (Yellow bar).\n\n\n\n\nVisualization 2\nHere is a visual showing the top ten companies associated with the highest counts of plastic collected in descending order. The company associated with the highest count is La Doo with 15000 counts. Majority of the companies are food and beverage type companies or some type of personal care.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure. This is a bar graph that shows the top ten companies associated with the plastic collected in the survey.\n\n\n\n\nVisualization 3\nHere is a visual that displays the counts of plastic types. We can see the plastic type most commonly found was categorized as other. The plastic type found the least was categorized as Polyvinyl Chloride which is a non-recyclable type of plastic.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure.
